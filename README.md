OMIP1-OMIP2 comparison
========

  This repository contains scripts to process model outputs
  for an omip-1 and omip-2 intercomparison study,

  to Geoscientific Model Development (Tsujino et al. 2019).

  Note that this repository provides only scripts to process data.
  Data should be obtained separately, which will be made available at
  <https://climate.mri-jma.go.jp/pub/archives/Tsujino-et-al_OMIP/data>.
